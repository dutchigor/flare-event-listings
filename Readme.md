# Flare Event Listings
__Note: this plugin started out as a demo to teach myself Vue with Wordpress. It is still heavy on Vue but is being expanded to add the relevant backend functionality. The plugin is very much under development and should not be used in production.__

This WordPress plugin adds a listings post type. There are 2 types of listings:
- Program items. Together these form a program with a schedule per program location
- Service Providers. These are any parties that are represented in some way at the event outside of the officia program. E.g. food trucks.
Service providers and program locations can also be pinned on an image of the event layout.
A filterable collection of Service providers, program items or the event layout can be added to any page witha shortcode.
